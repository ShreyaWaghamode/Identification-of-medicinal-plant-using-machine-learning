This project aims to develop a mobile application for identifying medicinal plants and providing their names and benefits. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the model is trained on a dataset of medicinal plant images to recognize various species. The application, built using Android Studio and Java, allows users to upload images of plants and receive instant identification and information. This tool promotes awareness of the medicinal properties of plants, enhancing user knowledge and encouraging the use of natural remedies.
