 Project Overview:
This project develops a machine learning model to identify medicinal plants from images, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate classification.

Data Collection:
- Dataset: High-quality images of medicinal plants, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sharvan123/medicinal-plant/code).
- Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, resizing, normalization, augmentation, feature extraction, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

 Methodology:
- Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Validation: Train-validation split, cross-validation, and performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

 Results:
- Performance Metrics:
  - Accuracy: 90%
  - Precision: 0.92
  - Recall: 0.88
  - F1-score: 0.90
- Visualizations:** Confusion matrix and sample predictions.

 Conclusion:
- Key Findings:** High accuracy and effective plant identification.
- Future Directions:** Enhance data quality, address class imbalance, improve generalization, and deploy in real-time applications.
